# Learning-Booster

Simple web application assisting you during learning process.
Looking for useful sources of information via the internet, we usually find many links concerning films, tutorials, books, courses, etc. We save them, “add to favorites” and easily forget where they are when we need them. We have to check many times the same URLs.
The app allows to deal with that „mess” and organize learning process, especially choose the most useful sources of information and also plan costs and time.
